Site update 8-13-2020 Margo Kelly
The URL to my "Resume" site is MargoKellyTech.com . 

This resume site is a result of my taking the Cloud Resume Challenge given by Forrest Brazeal in the summer of 2020.
I had about a week before the deadline of July 31 2020 to figure out and implement the tasks involved. I was fortunate 
to already have a recent AWS certification and an AWS static test site on S3, so I adapted it for the challenge. I was able to 
complete 13 out of the 16 steps in the week before the deadline. It was very satisfying to figure out the many pieces 
I had not used before such as AWS SAM, API Gateway, GitHub Actions, Docker and DynamoDB. I learned a great deal and increased 
my skills in the process.
Currently, I am working on finishing up the TDD, blog and backend CI/CD parts of the challenge.


Below are the items of the challenge that I have completed so far:
(The items with an asterix are pending completion.)

1. AWS Certification - AWS Solutions Architect Associate
2. Resume using HTML.
3. Use CSS on resume page.
4. Create a static S3 Website.
5. Static website uses HTTPS.
6. Custom domain name in AWS Route53 and use AWS CloudFront distribution. My URL is MargoKellyTech.com.
7. Include a visitor counter implemented in JavaScript on the resume page.
8. Use DynamoDB to persist the value of the site counter. 
9. Create an API Gateway to trigger a Lambda function.
10. Use Python code and create an AWS Lambda function, triggered by the API, that will increment the count and 
    store the count in DynamoDB.
11. *Python TDD - pending completion.        
12. Configure and deploy the AWS resources using an AWS SAM template and AWS SAM CLI.
13. Create a private GitHub repository for the backend code.
14. *CI/CD (backend) - pending completion.
15. Create a private GitHub repository for the website code. Create a GitHub Action that will automatically
    update the S3 bucket when new code is pushed to the repository. 
16. *Blog post - pending completion.

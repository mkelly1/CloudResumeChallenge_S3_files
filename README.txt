Site update 7-30-2020  The URL for my site is margokellytech.com. There is a link to my resume in the nav bar.

This resume site is a result of taking the Cloud Resume Challenge given by Forrest Brazeal.
I had about a week to figure out and implement the tasks involved. I had a test site set up on AWS
so I adapted it for the challenge. I only discovered the challenge recently and so had about a week 
to accomplish as much of the challenge as I could. I was able to complete around 12 of the 16 steps.
It was very satisfying to figure out the many pieces I had not used before such as SAM, GitHub 
Actions, Docker and DynamoDB. This was truly challenging and I feel that I learned a great deal.

The following parts of the challenge that were completed and not yet completed:

1. AWS Certification - AWS Solutions Architect Associate
2. Resume in HTML and CSS.
3. Use CSS on resume page.
4. Static S3 Website.
5. Website uses HTTPS.
6. Custom domain name in Route53 and use CloudFront distribution.  URL margokellytech.com 
7. Include a visitor counter in JavaScript. -Partially completed
8. Use DynamoDB to persist the value of the site counter. 
9. Create an API Gateway to trigger a Lambda function.
10. Use Python code and create a Lambda function that will be triggered by the API, increment the count and 
    store the count in DynamoDB. This part works but there is a formatting issue with the web page JavaScript.
11. Not yet completed.        
12. Configure and deploy the AWS resources using an AWS SAM template and AWS SAM CLI.
13. Not yet completed.
14. Not yet completed.
15. Create a private GitHub repository for the website code. Create a GitHub Action that will automatically
    update the S3 bucket when new code is pused to the repository.
16. Not yet completed.
